List of commands:

Note: Square brackets specify required arguments, parentheses specify optional arguments, "|" means that both
arguments are equivalent and either is accepted, and a comma signifies alternative forms of the command.

read:-
	Description: Inputs the text file which contains the program. The file name is specified by FILE, without
	the .txt extension (for example, 'read program' will input program.txt). After specifying the file name for the
	first usage of 'read', the command can be used without an argument to reload the most recently loaded file. 
	note that the name of the last file read will be stored regardless of whether the read operation succeeded.
	Usage: read [FILE], read
print:-
	Description: Prints the inputted program, address table and assembly's binary output to the console, or 
	prints the contents of the memory location specified by ADDRESS.
	Usage: print, print memory [ADDRESS]

	the -f or --full flags are specified.
	Usage: log (-f | --full)
clear:-

	Usage: clear
assemble:-
	Description: assembles the inputted program into binary. Provides debug information if an error is encountered.
	Usage: assemble
load:-
	Description: Loads the binary program into memory, with each instruction loaded into it's specified address
	Usage: load
run:-
	Description: Runs the program from memory (program must be loaded with 'load' beforehand). Will begin from
